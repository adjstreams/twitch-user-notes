# Twitch User Notes

Add personal notes to usernames on Twitch — right from chat or browse views.

- Ever asked “Wait, who is this?” in a Twitch stream?
- This extension lets you right-click any username to add a personal note.
- Your notes appear as subtle tooltips across all Twitch pages.

All data is stored locally in your browser and never leaves your machine.
