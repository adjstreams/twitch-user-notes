# Privacy Policy for Twitch User Notes

Twitch User Notes is a local-first extension. Your data stays in your browser.

## 🔒 What we store

- Notes you create are saved using `chrome.storage.local`
- This data is stored only on your current browser profile and does **not** sync to other devices
- Uninstalling the extension deletes all stored notes

## 🚫 What we don’t do

- We do **not** collect, track, or transmit any personal information
- We do **not** use analytics, remote servers, or cloud storage
- We do **not** access Twitch credentials, stream content, or chat messages

Your notes are yours — always.

⚠️ If you export notes to a JSON file, keep it safe — it contains all note content in plain text.
